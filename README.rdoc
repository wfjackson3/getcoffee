This is a project I made for myself to use and thus includes lots of shortcuts. As a technical challenge for myself, I worked to accomplish a minimally functional product in the least amount of time possible. The total number of hours, including discover, was 15.5. I used many things that were new to me on this project, including:
Twitter bootstrap
Google maps
Rails 3.2 (asset pipeline)

Let me know if you have any questionsA
